/**
 * Context provider for observing the number of __open__ layering components (e.g. popups, dropdown menus) under the observer.
 * It uses a stable object to keep track of the number of open layered components - which means the observer will not re-render
 * when the number of layers changes.
 *
 * If this `OpenLayerObserver` has a parent `OpenLayerObserver`, it will also increment/decrement its parent observer's layer count.
 * This allows for nested `OpenLayerObserver` components to correctly track the number of open layers.
 *
 * It is intended for use with the `useOpenLayerObserver` hook.
