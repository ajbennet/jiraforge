 * The following workaround is required because functions cannot be passed outside of the runtime.
 * The Renderer will invoke the function from within the runtime
 * Instead of passing the function, we are reimplementing validation and confirmation here to provide the same behaviour as the ADS version.
 *
 * The reimplemented functions include:
 * - validate
 * - onConfirm
 * - onCancel
 * - onEdit
 *
 * readView and editView also need to be evaluated here so that into a primitive type(JS object) to be rendered by the Renderer. Otherwise the Renderer will not be able to evaluate them on the product side.
